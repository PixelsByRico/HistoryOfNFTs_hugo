## What are Mooncats? { .title }
MoonCats are an original NFT which launched in 2017. The project was a pioneerâ€  of on-chain generation, fair distribution, and user customization. With the support of the active community, the original development team continues to expand the MoonCatEcosystem.

### Supply { .title }
There are a total of 25,440 MoonCats, and Ponderware is committed to never minting any additional MoonCat tokens. Of these, 96 are known as Genesis Cats which are the only cats colored Black or White (sometimes with Grey), and 25,344 are Rescue Cats, selected by users during the minting process. Originally, 256 Genesis Cats were planned for release, but the remaining 160 were permanently locked as dictated by the outcome of the Genesis Vote in March 2021.

### MoonCat Winter & Rediscovery { .title }
MoonCatRescue was developed and released in 2017 by a pair of Ethereum enthusiasts who wanted to explore the possibilities of the early Ethereum network. The duo were artists and developers, but struggled to market the project effectively. Though MoonCats gained a small and passionate following, interest never ballooned and by late 2018 had dwindled to almost nothing. Ponderware kept the project on life support but the functionality of the interface dwindled and bitrot set in...

Fast forward to March 12, 2021, thanks to the efforts of crypto-archeologists like 0xAllen,Adam McNFT, ETHoard, & JUSTIN, MoonCats were rediscovered. In a bout of MoonCat mania, all of the remaining MoonCats were rescued over the span of just a few hours. Though you could still mine on the original website, actually claiming cats required that you interact with the smart contract directly, which people quickly learned and taught others to do. On this day, from grass roots, the MoonCatCommunity was born!

As soon as ponderware learned of the rediscovery, the team got to work re-establishing communication with the MoonBase. Upon the return of ponderware, the question of whether to mint the remaining Genesis MoonCats rose to the forefront. Ponderware's first act in joining the community was to put the issue to a vote, setting the stage for the ongoing atmosphere of community collaboration that continues today.

The project continues to develop and community continues to grow, as the #AgeOfMoonCats continues.

### On-Chain Generation { .title }
Each MoonCat's DNA (known as their catId) is a unique on-chain value which determines all the traits of the MoonCat. This DNA can then be expanded in the image of that MoonCat.

### Historical Significance
The MoonCatRescue project was a trailblazer in NFT systems and dynamics. Some of these innovations still stand-out in the space. The original website is preserved as an artifact.
