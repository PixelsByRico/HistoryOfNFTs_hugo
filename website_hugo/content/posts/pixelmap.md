How do I get the Tile Owner role?
If you own a PixelMap tile, head to the collabland-join channel to verify and receive the "Tile Owner" role.
How many tiles are there?  3,970 in total, numbered 0 through 3,969 (the last tile is invisible ;))

How old is PixelMap?
The contract launched on November 17, 2016 (Proof here: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x79e41799591e99ffb0aad02d270ac92328e441d0d6a0e49fd6cb9948efb40656)

What's the difference between a wrapped and unwrapped tile?  
PixelMap was launched in 2016, predating the ERC-721 standard by nearly a year.  Because of that, while you can still buy/sell/update unwrapped tiles, to list them on exchanges like OpenSea, LooksRare, etc., they have to be "wrapped."  Please note you can ALWAYS unwrap a wrapped tile and vice versa.  Most people choose to leave theirs wrapped for ease of use.

Can you change tile images and metadata after you wrap? 
Yes.  The wrapper exposes all OG contract functionality.

Who created PixelMap?
Created by Ken Erwin (Discord: kendog2012#3125, Twitter: @kenerwin88)

Which tile was the first to have an image?
#1984, set to a spider.  Wallet owned by Ken, password is still unknown sadly! ðŸ˜„

How much did it cost to buy a tile in 2016?
All 3,970 tiles were listed at 2E at launch.  At the time, that was roughly $20, with 20-30 sales.  Most tiles were relisted at 0.35E in August 2021, selling instantly.   Others sold via lottery for 0.7E.  They now often sell for over $10k.

Can more PixelMap tiles be minted?
No, a limit of 3,970 is hardcoded into the original contract.  all 25 440 MoonCats have been rescued.

Why aren't there 3,970 tiles on OpenSea etc.?
Exchanges can only see "wrapped" tiles.  Most of the "unwrapped" tiles appear to be held by long-term HODLERS.

Are there many "DEAD" tiles that will never have an image?
No, the vast majority were sold in August 2021 (with a value over $10k+).  It is unlikely that the wallets holding them are missing.  Most owners from 2016 have been found, with an estimated ten tiles or less missing (and already have an image on them). 
How do I wrap my tile?
Visit https://pixelmap.io/, log in with MetaMask, then click the "Wrapper" link at the top left.  It will guide you through the process.  TLDR, you buy the tile from yourself using the wrapper contract.

Is there a Dune Dashboard, how can we track distribution, etc.?
Yes!  https://dune.xyz/rantum/NFT-Collection-Dashboard?contract_address=x050dc61dfb867e0fe3cf2948362b6c0f3faf790b -- Please note, it can ONLY track wrapped tiles.

I want a tile, which one should I buy! 
First off, welcome to the family :D.  Secondly, it ultimately depends on what you like!  Many people have placed a higher value on tiles near the center, on edges, on groups of tiles, or maybe you prefer the history of a specific tile?  Also, you CAN update the image and URL on the tile (stored directly on-chain).  A floor tile is always a safe bet, but if one looks a bit cooler for a bit more, we don't blame you.

What does on-chain mean?
Most NFTs do NOT store the art and other details on the Blockchain, as it is significantly cheaper to point to a link on IPFS or even a standar

What was the "rediscovery"?
In August 2021, Adam McBride, an NFT Archaeologist, discovered PixelMap's contract while digging for old projects.  He then located the creator (Ken Erwin) and helped revive the project (it had laid dormant from 2017-2020, before the explosion in interest in NFTs).

What is a PixelMap Time Capsule?
Time Capsules document a period in PixelMap's history and are given to the owners of tiles that fit the requirements.  For example, the "OG 18x18" time capsule celebrates the first 324 tiles (18x18) to have an image on them.  You can read more about them here: https://pixelmap.io/timecapsule, or find them on OpenSea at https://opensea.io/collection/pixelmap-time-capsules.
